			<h1>Data of my Toyota</>
			<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>It was a challenge to figure out how to make the console
					correct and look nice. I kept getting an error on the output.</p>
			<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>For some reason I am not able to link my picture. I've checked over
					the code multiple times but whenever I test it on the local file it
					doesn't want to show up. I wonder if I have a small error in my html and
					am not linking it properly?</p>
			<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>I have a webpage with js visible but I do not yet have a picture of the
					Toyota. We will see if more troubleshooting works.</p>
