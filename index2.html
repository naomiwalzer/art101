  	<p> Naomi Walzer is based in San Francisco and is working towards a degree in Fine Arts at the University of California Santa Cruz. Naomi is a multi-media artists with emphasis on lithography, sculpture and painting.
      Their art focuses on self: attempting to convey how it feel to live in a body add odds with itself. They make art surrounding pleasure, pain, euphria, dysphoria and all that lies in-between.
      Much of their work is representational.</p>

      <p2>Naomi has participated in and curated several art shows, one of which was a group show that took place at Subrosa in Santa Cruz. They hope to do a large tea party in a field on campus filled with
        works of art that one can touch, consume and manipulate.
        They hope that this process will provide a different experience of an art show that
        is separate from the sometimes unfeeling, confining space of a gallery. </p2>
