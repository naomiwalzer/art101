			<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>I struggled with figuring out the last part of the equation. Am i supposed to give the answer to the equation at the end?</p>
			<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I wasn't able to fully get the function working on the console so it was not completely correct in my js.</p>
			<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>The console worked for the most part and I was able to give it a function and print an array but the rest was a bit of a struggle</p>
