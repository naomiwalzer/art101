    <h1>Lab 7 - Functions</h1>
    <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <p>Today the challenge is to be able to take a string from a user and
          turn into a string and then turn it back into a string.</p>
    <h2>Problems</h2>
        <p>I think the issue we encountered was that since we took a while to
          start this lab we were a bit rusty on java scripts such as var and
          console.log. I think I will create a quizlet for myself to stay
          fresh on these terms.</p>
    <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>We were able to succesfully print the username after having been
          sorted.</p>
