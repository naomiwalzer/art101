    <h1>Lab 9 - Javascript for the Web </h1>
    <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <p>It was challenging to figure out how to
					create an element and assign it to a new variable but once we did it was very satisfying</p>
    <h2>Problems</h2>
        <p>I was not able to add our second element or link
					our CSS from JS</p>
    <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>I'm still learning java script! It was very much
					trial and error with this lab but I was able to get the basics up to step 4</p>
