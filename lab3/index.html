			<h1>Lab 3 File Structures</h1>
			<p>The purpose of this lab was to create a local file structure
				and link file structures on my index.html.</p>
			<h2>Challenges</h2>
			<p>It was difficult at first to figure out how to link my photo but eventually
				I realized how to add it to my img file under the art101 folder.</p>
			 <h2>Results</h2>
			 <p> We created this index.html and a file structure! I'm very proud. Here it is:</p>
			 <img src="img/screenshot2task3.png" width=650>
		</body>
</html>
